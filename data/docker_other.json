Somehow I get just a clear Website, even when I curl the webseite I get zero response.I have made a look into the Caddyserver logs and WordPress logs and I get the request, but no response. I also installed nginx as a container and served the nginx to Caddy to see if Caddy is proxying correctly. I get the welcome screen from nginx.
